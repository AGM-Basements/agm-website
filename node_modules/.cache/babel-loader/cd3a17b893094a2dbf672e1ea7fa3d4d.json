At different stages you are consulted when design / construction / finish changes are needed at critical stages (I have had previous project contractors make unilateral decisions with less than desirable outcomes). The finishing touches make all of the difference... paint touch-ups, small fixes, TV wall bracket installation & TV mounting, new light & electrical outlet in storage room (slightly out-of-scope but done anyway) and additional pipe & shutoff valve for our water filter to name just a few accommodations. You get a professional project manager who answers his cell and emails outside of business hours when you have concerns or questions.  The value of this project was over $50k... worth every penny.

work! Courteous & professional staff. Quality products & finishes. Attention to detail. Project started one month late (my bad... I forgot to get a  building permit) and AGM accommodated us by not cashing our post dated cheques until work started up again!! At different stages you are consulted when design / construction / finish changes are needed at critical stages (I have had previous project contractors make unilateral decisions with less than desirable outcomes). The finishing touches make all of the difference... paint touch-ups, small fixes, TV wall bracket installation & TV mounting, new light & electrical outlet in storage room (slightly out-of-scope but done anyway) and additional pipe & shutoff valve for our water filter to name just a few accommodations. You get a professional project manager who answers his cell and emails outside of business hours when you have concerns or questions.  The value of this project was over $50k... worth every penny. I would strongly recommend AGM... they will be a bit more than their competition however their expertise, adhere to to the latest building codes,  tradespeople are second to none.\"\n      },\n      {\n        person: \"Valerie A.\",\n        link:\n          \"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109797041282582010158/reviews\",\n        text:\n          \"We hired AGM to create a small basement suite for our son.
