          <h3>Health and Safety</h3>

          <p>As well as undergoing regular health and safety checks, our basement builders and technicians offer a professional radon detection service. Radon gas is radioactive and one of the leading causes of lung cancer. If pockets of radon gas are present on your property, they are most likely to be disturbed during renovations. This is why we are proud to offer a service that is so vital to protecting the health of both yourself and your family.</p>
